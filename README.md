## Git Command Line Practice & Repository Setup

This repository is a documentary of my study and practice of Version Control and Git fundamentals. I learned how to set up a repository using the command line and practiced several essential Git commands.

## Setting Up the Repository

I set up this repository using the command line with the following commands:

1. **Initialize a New Repository**
   git init

2. **Add Files to the Staging Area**
   git add .
   
4. **Commit the changes**
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Set up repository and added README"

5. **Create a New Branch**
   git branch feature-branch

6. **Switch to a New Branch**
   git checkout feature-branch

7. **Merge Branch Changes**
   git checkout main
   git merge feature-branch

8. **Add a Remote Repository**
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

9. **Push Changes to the Remote Repository**
    git push -u origin main

10. **Checking Status**
    git status

11. **Resetting Changes**
    git reset --hard

# Conclusion
This project has helped me build confidence in using Git via the command line. I now have a better understanding of how version control works, the importance of branching for collaborative development, and how to manage my code history effectively.
